#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT (orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT (orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' ;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum 
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, price 
FROM JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN (price) FROM JanSales);

(another way to get the answer)
SELECT DISTINCT product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue ,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity) * price AS revenue 
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT (distinct customers.acctnum), AVG (quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
JOIN  customers ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM (Quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product 
ORDER BY SUM (Quantity) DESC

#9.Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location 
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2;

#10. How many of each type of headphone was sold in February?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM (Quantity) AS Quantity
FROM FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%headphone%' 
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM (Quantity) DESC

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers ON orderID = order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
